If you're looking to help out contributing and adding your feature on it, fork first the repo. Then you will have to clone, first make sure that [Openplanet](https://openplanet.nl) is installed on your game (Trackmania or ManiaPlanet), then you will have to clone the repo to:

- `C:\Users\%username%\OpenplanetNext\Plugins\` for Trackmania Next (2020)
- `C:\Users\%username%\Openplanet4\Plugins\` for ManiaPlanet (Trackmania²)

⚠ If you're cloning on Trackmania Next, make sure that you're running the Club edition of the game. [Read more here](https://openplanet.nl/next/club)

## Making PRs

When you adding a feature and making a PR, please make it to the `develop` branch. The `main` branch will be the delivery branch to end users. Thanks!
